# Terrain Tile Prompts (48px)

These prompts target the core terrain tiles at 48x48. Each line is a ready-to-use description for manual generation.

Global style (apply to all): pixel art, 48x48, warm earth tones, dwarven stonework, subtle cracks, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, light from upper-left, full tile (no transparency).

## Stone

- stone_01.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down stone floor tile, warm earth tones, dwarven stonework with medium block shapes and light mortar gaps, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 01: balanced block pattern."
- stone_02.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down stone floor tile, warm earth tones, dwarven stonework with smaller stones and more pebbly texture, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 02: tighter pebble texture."
- stone_03.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down stone floor tile, warm earth tones, dwarven stonework with medium block shapes, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 03: scattered pebble texture and a few chipped edges."
- stone_04.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down stone floor tile, warm earth tones, dwarven stonework with irregular stones and larger block cuts, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 04: more irregular stones and varied block sizes."

## Hard Rock

- hard_rock_01.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down hard rock tile, darker brown-gray stone, rugged texture, visible cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 01: heavy rough grain."
- hard_rock_02.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down hard rock tile, darker brown-gray stone with jagged slab cuts, deeper cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 02: slabby structure."
- hard_rock_03.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down hard rock tile, darker brown-gray stone, heavier rugged texture with striations, visible cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 03: rugged striations."
- hard_rock_04.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down hard rock tile, dark brown-gray stone, jagged slab cuts with deep cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 04: larger slab shapes."

## Dense Rock

- dense_rock_01.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down dense rock tile, very dark charcoal-brown stone, compact texture, minimal cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 01: tight dense pattern."
- dense_rock_02.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down dense rock tile, very dark charcoal stone, compact texture with faint layered grain, minimal cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 02: subtle banding."
- dense_rock_03.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down dense rock tile, very dark charcoal-brown stone, compact texture, minimal cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 03: fine granular texture."
- dense_rock_04.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down dense rock tile, deep charcoal stone, dense mass with faint crystalline specks, minimal cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 04: faint speckled inclusions, slightly higher contrast."

## Ancient Stone

- ancient_stone_01.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down ancient stone tile, aged warm stone blocks, dwarven geometric pattern, chipped edges, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 01: clean geometric pattern."
- ancient_stone_02.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down ancient stone tile, aged warm stone blocks, worn geometric carvings, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 02: softer carved lines."
- ancient_stone_03.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down ancient stone tile, aged warm stone blocks, dwarven geometric pattern, chipped edges, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 03: faint rune etchings with low glow accents."
- ancient_stone_04.png: "48x48 pixel art top-down ancient stone tile, aged warm stone blocks, worn geometric carvings, heavier chips and wear, subtle cracks, light from upper-left, crisp pixel edges, seamless tile edges, full tile (no transparency). Variant 04: heavier wear and chips."
