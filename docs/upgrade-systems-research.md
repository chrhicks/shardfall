## Design Insights

### Common Upgrade Patterns

1. **Start with direct power** - Damage, speed, production
2. **Add multipliers** - Gold value, efficiency gains
3. **Introduce automation** - Managers, auto-collect, idle bonuses
4. **Layer in luck** - Crit chance, rare events, bonus drops
5. **Meta upgrades** - Prestige bonuses that multiply everything

### Upgrade Progression Philosophy

| Early Game | Mid Game | Late Game |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Direct stat boosts | Multipliers & automation | Meta/prestige efficiency |
| Linear scaling | Exponential costs | Soft caps & diminishing returns |
| Simple choices | Trade-off decisions | Build optimization |

### Balancing Considerations

- **Multiplicative stacking** creates exponential power growth
- **Soft caps** (diminishing returns) prevent runaway scaling
- **Hard caps** (max levels) create clear goals
- **Prestige resets** compress the power curve periodically
